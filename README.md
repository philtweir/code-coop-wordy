wordy
=====

This is a partial solution to the Exercism Rust challenge:
http://exercism.io/exercises/rust/wordy/readme

It follows a Code Co-op where we introduced a group of
enthusiastic people to Rust and set them all to work
solving this problem!

To compile:

```
    rustc wordy.rs
    rustc mini.rs
```

For the `mini` example, enter statements line by line as:

    What is NUM1 OP NUM2?

where `NUMn` are anything parseable as a float and `OP` is
one of `plus`, `minus`, `times` or `over`.

For the `wordy` example, enter statements line by line as:

    What is NUM1 OP1 NUM2 OP2 NUM3 OP3 ...?

where `NUMn` are anything parseable as a float and `OP` is
one of `plus`, `minus`, `times` or `divided by`.
